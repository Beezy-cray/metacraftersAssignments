# beezyCoin

beezyCoin is an ERC-20 token implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

The beezyCoin contract has public variables that store the details about the token, such as its name, abbreviation, and total supply

. It also has a mapping of addresses to balances, which keeps track of how many tokens each address holds.

The contract includes a mint function that takes an address and a value as parameters. 

This function increases the total supply of tokens by the specified value and increases the balance of the specified address by that amount.

The contract also includes a burn function that works in the opposite way of the mint function. 

This function takes an address and a value as parameters and decreases the total supply of tokens by the specified value. 

It also decreases the balance of the specified address by that amount. 

The burn function includes a conditional statement to ensure that the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the amount being burned.

## Getting Started

## Installing

To install and use beezyCoin, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. 

You can then interact with the beezyCoin contract on the Ethereum blockchain using your wallet.

## Executing

To execute functions on the beezyCoin contract, you will need to send transactions to the contract address from your Ethereum wallet.

You can use your walletâ€™s interface to specify which function you want to call and provide any necessary parameters.
